Intructions:

There are two kind of Actors: Players and Challenges; and three kind of items Perks, Quirks and Afflictions.

In the Player Sheet

On the Rank number:
    - Left click increases current value
    - Right click decreases current value

On the trait icon (beside Rank and concept)
    - Left click cycles through "Agile" (juggler icon), "Brawny" (strong man icon) and "Crafty" (brain icon)

On Resolve (heart) and Karma (clover):
    - Left click decreases current value
    - Right click increases current value
    - Shift + Left click decreases Max value (max 6)
    - Shift + Right click increases Max value (min 1)

On Afflictions (skull);
    - Shift + Left click increases Max value (max 6)
    - Shift + Right click decreases Max value (min 1)

To add a Perk, Quirk or Affliction to the sheet, you'll have to create it in the Items tab and drop it in your character sheet. 
When you add or remove an affliction the affliction marker (skull icon) will automatically update.

You'll see that in the items sheets there are, apart form the name and a description text field, a tag field with two color selectors.
There you can write a tag that will be displayed in the items list in the character sheet, beside the item name. 
The color selectors are for the background and font colors.
This way you can add, for example, a Perk and mark it as a "Spell" or "Fantasy Race" or whatever. Or mark an affliction as maybe "Mental" or whatever you like.
This feature is available for all item types (Perk, Quirk and Affliction)

In the Challenge Sheet

On the Rank number:
    - Left click increases current value
    - Right Click Increases current value

    - Shift + Left click decreases Max value (Max 43)
    - Shift + Right Click increases current value (min 1)

such as Knacks, Subtraits and Substyles. The Tricube Tactics initiative is set as the default one.
